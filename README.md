# Khumalo-Automobiles
This was a website I built for a friend of mine who has an eSports team and wants to get into the MotorSports and Automotive Industry.
To build this website I used open-source icons and linked his social media pages to those icons and also coded for the email to be clickable and send the user straight to gmail.
I also used media inquiries so that website will appear neat to users with different screen sizes.
